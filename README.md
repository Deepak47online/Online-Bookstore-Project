# Online-Bookstore-Project
In this project, I analyzed a structured dataset using advanced SQL querying techniques to extract meaningful business insights. I performed end-to-end data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and insight generation by applying a wide range of SQL functions and operations.

Key tasks included filtering data, aggregating metrics, identifying trends, and generating summary reports.
The project demonstrated my ability to work with large datasets and use SQL efficiently for analytical decision-making.

# SQL Functions & Techniques Used:
Filtering & Sorting: WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT /
Aggregation: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX() /
Grouping & Segmentation: GROUP BY, HAVING
Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, SELF JOIN
String Functions: CONCAT(), LTRIM(), RTRIM(), SUBSTRING(), UPPER(), LOWER(), LENGTH()
Date Functions: DATEDIFF(), DATEADD(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()
Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), LAG()
Data Cleaning Operations: handling null values using IS NULL, COALESCE(), replacing blanks
Table Operations: CREATE, ALTER, UPDATE, DELETE
Performance Optimization: using indexes, limiting data with LIMIT/TOP
